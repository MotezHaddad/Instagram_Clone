Custom Icons: The app utilizes the bootstrap_icons package to access a variety of icons, including Instagram-like icons for user interactions.

Bottom Navigation Bar: The bottom navigation bar provides quick access to essential app sections, such as the home feed, search, creating new posts, trending videos (reels), and user profiles.

Video Paging: The app uses a PageView widget with vertical scrolling to display a list of video reels. Users can swipe up and down to navigate through different reels.

Interactive Icons: Icons representing user interactions are displayed on top of the videos. These icons provide options for liking, commenting, sharing, and more.

Profile Display: The user profile information is shown at the bottom of the screen, including the user's profile picture, username, and a follow button.

Bottom Navigation Bar: A BottomAppBar is implemented at the bottom of the screen, providing navigation to different app sections. Icons are used to represent each section.

Interactive Icons: User interaction icons, including liking, commenting, sharing, and more, are placed on top of the videos for intuitive interaction.

Profile Display: The user's profile picture, username, and follow button are displayed at the bottom of the screen, providing information about the current video's uploader.
